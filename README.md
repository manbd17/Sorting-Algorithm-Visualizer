# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Visual representation of Sorting algorithms 

A web application explaining the working of sorting algorithms through visualization. 

Sorting algorithms implemented:

Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort

Features:

Colored representation  : 
1.1) Blue:default
1.2) Yellow: Being compared 
1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 
1.4) Green: In correct position

Controls for Visualization : 
2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
2.2) Data size 
2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).

Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
